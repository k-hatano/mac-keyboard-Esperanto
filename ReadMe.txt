A set of super convenient keyboard layout schemata for the Esperanto language.


Homepage:

  https://github.com/jakwings/mac-keyboard-Esperanto


Installation:

  Just drop Esperanto.bundle into the directory "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts".
  "~" is an alias for your home directory (e.g. "/Users/ada").

  In Finder you can use the shortcut Command+Shift+G and then go to the
  directory by entering "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" (without the quotes).

  If this is not your first time to install these keyboard layouts, remove the
  old layouts first. Next, logout and login again. Then reinstall.

  Finally, use the system preferences to add this layout. Enjoy! :-)


Features:

  * Based on multiple layouts of the English Apple keyboards.

  * More latin letters from the combinations of accents and letters.

  * Support the x-system:

      c + x/X = ĉ, C + x/X = Ĉ
      g + x/X = ĝ, G + x/X = Ĝ
      h + x/X = ĥ, H + x/X = Ĥ
      j + x/X = ĵ, J + x/X = Ĵ
      s + x/X = ŝ, S + x/X = Ŝ
      u + x/X = ŭ, U + x/X = Ŭ

  * Use ESC or Tab (or Shift + 0, _ if you use JIS keyboard) or irrelevant keys to cancel any incomplete combination:

      c + Tab = c, C + Tab = C
      g + Tab = g, G + Tab = G
      h + Tab = h, H + Tab = H
      j + Tab = j, J + Tab = J
      s + Tab = s, S + Tab = S
      u + Tab = u, U + Tab = U
      S + u + g + a + r + c + o + a + t + i + n + g + . = Sugarcoating.
